# Vockie

Vockie is a stupidly simple, [vocabulary trainer](http://vockievockie.appspot.com/) build on Google's appengine platform.

The following are its key features.

* Learns as you go.
* Remembers your progress.
* Stays out of your way.
* Google manages your login so you don't have to trust me.
* **Most importantly** pulls snazzy color palettes from [colourlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/). :)

## Architecture

![Alt text](http://j.imagehost.org/0474/mvc.png)

* MVC with separate controllers for static and AJAX requests.
* Templated HTML, HTML fragment and CSS generation.
